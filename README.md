The AdvisorBot is a stock trading assistant that gives the user data about the stock market over the 
current timeframe or a set of timeframes. It allows the user to quickly see important trading 
information about stock data. It is an adaptation of the MerkelMain project and utilizes some of the 
same functions while also implementing other interesting informative functions with the sole 
purpose of providing a user with clarity on a trading environment so that informed decisions can be 
made when bidding and buying. Some of the new functionalities include seeing all the products 
being sold and bought in a time step, finding the min, max and average bids or buys over a set of 
time steps, predicting the min/max ask/bid for a specified product for the next time step, showing 
the current time, stepping over one or more time steps and calculating the standard deviation for 
the current time step. This program requires C++17, because of specific commands that are used 
that are only available in this version of C++
